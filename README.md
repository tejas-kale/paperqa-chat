# PaperQA Chatbot

## Ideas for experimentation/improvement
- [ ] When evaluating the results, check the correlation between answer length and number of sources. For example, for a one-line answer, do we get the same results when using 1 or 3 sources?
- [ ] In the chatbot, use a [manifest file](https://futurehouse.gitbook.io/futurehouse-cookbook/paperqa#manifest-files)
- [ ] Use [caching](https://futurehouse.gitbook.io/futurehouse-cookbook/paperqa#using-external-db-vector-db-and-caching)
- [ ] Use [resuable index](https://futurehouse.gitbook.io/futurehouse-cookbook/paperqa#reusing-index)
- [ ] Experiment and evaluate [prompts](https://futurehouse.gitbook.io/futurehouse-cookbook/paperqa#customizing-prompts)
